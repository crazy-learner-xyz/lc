总：
Two pointer. l, r pointer, l,r initialized to be 0, r keep going right, and always record max_len. Keep track of the last best maximum and minimum value of the current subarray as we move r to the right is very important.

P.S. I think Leetcode sliding window category is about the same as Leetcode two pointer category.
